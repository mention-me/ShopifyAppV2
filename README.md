# Mention Me Shopify App (Alpha)

This app is a prototype of how Mention Me might implement our journey with the Shopify Checkout Extensibility changes.

This application is work in progress, and we recommend reaching out to us at support@mention-me.com if you're interested in using it.

# API Types

We install types for each of the APIs we use from Mention Me.

The identifiers come from the developers.mention-me.com API reference.

Installed via:

```bash
npx api@next install -i "entry-point-api" "@mention-me/v2.0#72sflxkmgq91"
npx api@next install -i "consumer-api" "@mention-me/v2.0#15d5t3klxkmgofm"
```
